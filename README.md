Udacity  Project:
--------------------------
* I used while loop with True Condition to loop over user input .
* Used If Statments to handle errors during run time .
* Used methods from Numpy as np to calculate stat that required for the Project.
* create rawdata function that takes df as an argument to ask user for displaying more data if required .
* use pandas data frame to read CSV files and extract data from theses files for productive information .
* i created three cloumns from start time to month, day , hour to diplay data required.
